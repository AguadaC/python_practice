# Overview

The provided script defines a function `find_two_sum` that identifies two elements in a list of numbers whose sum is equal to a given target sum. The function handles various scenarios, including input validation and raising exceptions for invalid inputs.

# How to Use

## Requirements:

- Python: The script uses Python and requires it to be installed on your system.
- `numpy` Library: The `numpy` library is used for numerical operations. Install it using the command:
    - `pip install numpy`

## Usage:

1. Download the script and save it as a `.py` file, e.g., `two_sum_finder.py`.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the script.

3. Run the script using the command:
    - `python two_sum_finder.py`


## Function:

The `find_two_sum` function takes two arguments: a list of integers called `numbers` and an integer called `target_sum`. It returns a tuple of two integers, representing the indices of two elements whose sum matches the `target_sum`. If no such elements are found, it returns `None`.

### Parameters:

- `numbers` (List[int]): A list of integers.
- `target_sum` (int): The target sum to be achieved.

### Returns:

- Tuple[int, int] or None: A tuple containing the indices of the two elements whose sum is equal to the target sum, or None if no such elements are found.

### Exceptions:

- `ValueError`: Raised if `numbers` is not a list of integers, if `target_sum` is not an integer, or if `numbers` has fewer than two elements.
